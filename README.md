# Custom-SQL-Queries-AdventureWorks-DB

This repository has evolved through many different stages through its lifecycle to what it is now. I consider it to be the most up to date show of my SQL knowledge. It contains various Queries from the 2012 Microsoft AdventureWorks database, and also practice questions I have solved on Leetcode or other coding practice websites.

All of these are ran with T-SQL on Microsoft SSMS.

AdventureWorks 2012 db can be downloaded from this URL:
